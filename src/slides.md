- Background
  - Web development
    - Always an interest of mine
    - Huge area
    - Browser testing is mainly example/scenario based
  - Property-based testing
    - Last few years
        - Blog posts
        - Book: "Property-Based Testing in a Screencast Editor"
    - State machine testing for UIs
      - Lots of work
      - Boilerplate
      - Requires a full model
  - Formal methods
    - F*
    - TLA+
    - Temporal logics
  - Quickstrom
    - Idea: mix these together
      - Use temporal logic and learnings from formal methods
      - Use it for browser testing
        - Leverage the DOM and introspective capabilities
      - Run as property-based tests
    - Started in April 2020
